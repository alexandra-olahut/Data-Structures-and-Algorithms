Laboratory homeworks:  

1 - ADT Set – represented as a dynamic array of elements  
2 - ADT SortedMap – using a SLL with (key, value) pairs ordered based on a relation on the
keys  
3 - ADT SortedMultiMap – using a DLLA with (key, value) pairs ordered based on a relation on
the keys  
4 - ADT MultiMap – using a hashtable with open addressing and quadratic probing in which
(key, value) pairs are stored  
5 - ADT SortedBag – using a BST with linked representation on an array. In the BST (unique
element, frequency) pairs are stored
